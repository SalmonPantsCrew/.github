# Salmon Pants Crew

## About Us
We are a group of friends that got together because of Splatoon, we have known each other for a couple years and hang out all the time. 3 of us stream on twitch, and each have a Youtube channel where we *sometimes* post edited videos.

Feel free to check out our website at: https://salmonpantscrew.github.io (Website is currently unfinished)

Hello, and welcome to Squibs Land! I am Squibs, the person who runs these streams. I play splatoon and zelda games, and enjoy chatting with the rest in this server. This channel and the discord server are LGBTQ+ and Furry supportive, as well as anything else! I hope you enjoy your stay!
